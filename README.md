# Project 1: 2D Physics-Based Gameplay
A simple 2D physics-based action game by Mera Alfawares.

## Game Instructions
The aim is to catch at least one coin! Use the slider on the left to adjust the angle at which you are launching the alien. Then, press and hold down on your space bar to increase the strength of your launch. Releasing the space bar will launch the alien - hopefully, towards the coins!

## Project Report
Though somewhat time consuming, this project was rather fun to work on. Throughout the process, I found myself referencing previous projects and in-class tutorials. This allowed me to piece together different parts from each project, then further build on that using what I've learnt about Godot so far. For example, to set up the coins for this project, I referenced what we did in class for the Collector tutorial. 
There was one feature that I found particularly difficult as I didn't have a lot of previous experience with; the visual angle indicator. However, combining what I could find about the Line2D node and what I've learnt about Vector2D, I was able to add a short trajectory line that adjusts with the user's selected angle. 

- [ ] D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.
- [x] D-2: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.
- [X] D-3: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [x] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [ ] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [x] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
- [X] C-5: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
- [X] C-6: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
- [X] C-7: The player can fire the projectile.
- [X] C-8: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
- [X] C-9: There is a &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that stops the projectile.
- [X] C-10: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
- [x] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [X] B-2: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0&deg; (straight forward) and 90&deg; (straight up).
- [X] A-1: The player can modify the strength of the projectile's firing.
- [X] A-2: There is a visual indicator showing the angle at which the projectile will fire.
- [X] A-3: The projectile's hitting the target is recognized and logged to the console or otherwise indicated.

I have attempted to complete everything off the checklist. Unless I have misunderstood a specific point and failed to complete it, I would hope to get an A. In the game, you can control angle and strength, there is a non-ground target, a visual indicator of the angle, a recognition of hitting the target, and a ground to stop the projectile. Most importantly, you can fire a projectile which is affected by gravity. 
In addition, all the project and repository files were created and complete.
