# Project 1: 2D Physics-Based Gameplay
A simple 2D physics-based action game by Mera Alfawares.

## Game Instructions
Try to catch all the coins! Use the slider on the left to adjust the angle at which you are launching the alien. Then, press and hold down on your space bar to increase the strength of your launch. Releasing the space bar will launch the alien - hopefully, towards the coins! You have three lives to catch as many coins as you can.

## Project Report
During this iteration, I was able to get the animation and main menu tasks done rather quickly. This allowed me plenty of time to review the style guide and edit my code accordingly. There were not any great changes that I had to make, however, I did need to be thorough when going through each variable, function, etc. to make sure that it fits the documentation's notes. I found myself checking each file repeatedly and upon reflection, I recognize that one should review the style guide _before_ beginning a project. I also noticed that I would often be too preoccupied with completing the assignment that I forget to commit the changes for each new feature. Due to that, I end up having to clump all my changes into one commit, which is not good practice. To improve in future projects, I will place certain "checkpoints" to remind myself to commit and push, before moving on to the next step.
